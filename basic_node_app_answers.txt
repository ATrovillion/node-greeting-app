What is a Node module?

A Node module is a set of functions that can be imported or included in an application. Modules work similarly to JavaScript libraries.

What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

Module.exports is a variable that gets returned from a require() statement. It is empty by default, and can be changed to anything.
Exports, on the other hand, is never returned. It is an alias used as a reference to module.exports, and can be used as a convenience variable to help in writing leaner code.

Why is using exports recommended?

The use of exports is recommended because errors in its use (e.g., erroneous assignment) don't prevent the use of imported modules. If, on the other hand, an erroneous
change were to be made to module.exports, the thing itself (i.e., module.exports, the thing to which exports merely serves as a reference) is changed, and functionality
could be lost.
